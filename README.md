# SwerveDrive-2023
This is just the old stuff plus a bit of improvement plus imported into 2023

Changes: 

ARM SUBSYSTEM!
Added Arm Subsystem! Still need to plug in the PID controller values (Arm & Wrist PID controllers) and Signal Channels (for the Encoder)

AUTONOMOUS! 
Added some autonomous functions and skeletons. Not fully functional yet and needs a LOT of dubugging.
